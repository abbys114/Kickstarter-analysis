# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose
This projects goal was to help our client, Louise, analyze how other campaigns compared to her own campaign for her play _Fever_.  Specifically we compared other campaigns launch dates and their funding goals.  Using this data we were able to determind the best time to launch a campagin and  optimal funding goal to make the most sucessful campgain.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through the use of pivot tables and line charts, we were able to sort out the data, to better understand how the launch date effected the success of the campaign.  First we created a pivot table and filtered it to only include theatre campaigns.  Then rows were made containing the 12 months and colums showing the possible campaign outcomes.  The possible outcomes were successful, failed, and canceled.  Then we plotted the data in a line graph.  Shown in the graph below, the data shows May has the highest amount of successful campaigns based on the launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The Campaign goal amounts can help predict how successful a campaign will be.  We created a chart and divided the goal amounts into $5,000 increments, which then showed the percent successful, failed, and canceled for the increment.  Then the data was created into a line graph which showed that campaigns that had a goal under $10,000 had a higher success percentage then failed ones, along with goals ranging $30,000 and $35,000.  This can be seen in the chart below.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Based on the data collected on campaign outcomes based on launch date, May is the best month to start a campaign.  This month had the highest number of successful campaigns as well as having the greatest percent of successful campaigns compared to failedand canceled campaigns durring this month.  Another conclusion that can be made from this data is that December is the worst month to launch a campaign.  This month had the lowest amount of successful campains as well as lowest percent. 

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude that outcomes based on goals show that campaigns with goals less then $10,000 were more successful then campaigns with goals greater then $10,000.  This being said, campaigns with goals between $35,000 and $40,000, had a higher number of successful campaigns compared to failed and canceld ones also. 

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations to this data could be that the results could vary country to country on the outcomes based on launch date and on campaign goals.  We also do not know the genres of the successful play campaigns versus the failed and canceled ones, which could effect the success of funding a campaign.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some other tables and graphs that could be created could be to seperate the data by country.  We could also create tables and graphs about the years of these campaigns to see if campaigns have become more successful or not over the years.
